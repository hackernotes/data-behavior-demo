# Hackernotes.io data-behavior demo

This app is a companion to the post at [hackernotes.io/data-behavior](http://hackernotes.io/data-behavior). It is a Ruby on Rails app with no dependencies beyond what is indicated in the Gemfile. To run it, simply execute:

    $ bundle install

And...

    $ bin/rake db:migrate

And...

    $ bin/rake db:seed    

And...

    $ bin/rails server

The server will listen on its default port, 3000, and you can find the app at http://localhost:3000.
